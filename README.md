# Welcome to your Expo app

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to set up the development environment is using Docker:

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed

2. Build and start the development server:
   ```bash
   ./docker-setup.sh build
   ./docker-setup.sh start
   ```

3. Access Expo DevTools at http://localhost:19002

For detailed Docker setup instructions, see [DOCKER_SETUP.md](./DOCKER_SETUP.md).

### Option 2: Native Setup

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
